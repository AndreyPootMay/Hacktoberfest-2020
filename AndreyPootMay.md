Show me the code.” - Linus Torvalds|I would love to join more communities like these that allow us to cross the language barrier and learn from each other, as well as contributing to different applications by providing solutions from different points of view. I think it is a very good initiative to encourage open source. - Niger Andrey Poot May|
